# Installation

## Elasticsearch
To run elasticsearch go to the elasticsearch installation folder, open the directory elasticsearch/bin. and then run the command ``elasticsearch.bat``

If you want to run it on a docker container, first you have to create the container. 
 - Use the command:
    - ``docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.12.1``
 - Once the container is created, run the command:
    -  ``docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.12.1`` This exposes the 9200 port to requests. 

## Backend
First you have to build the backend app with ``gradle``: ``gradle build``
Than you can run the ``uber-jar`` generated by ``gradle`` located in ``build\libs\Cri_Art.jar`` by executing the following command: ``java -jar build\libs\Cri_Art.jar``

Or you can containerize it in a ``docker image``: ``docker build -t cri_art_backend .``

And run it with ``docker``: ``docker run -p 8080:8080 cri_art_backend``

## Frontend
You can run the application by using ``npm``: ``npm start``

Or you can containerize it in a ``docker image``: ``docker build -t cri_art_frontend .``

And run it with ``docker``: ``docker run -p 3000:3000 cri_art_frontend``
